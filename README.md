# Optimized Brushing

View live: <https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-fast-brushing/>

Brushing is a powerful technique of interactive graphics, highlighting linked data in multiple views. When it was developed in the 1980s, brushing was limited to a few hundred points.  On modern hardware, we can brush many more.

This Observable Framework example demonstrates usability and performance optimizations for brushing. The source code for this example is in [`src/index.md`](./src/index.md?plain=1).
